    <h1>Lowkey</h1>
    <h2>Sångtexten</h2>
    <p>Nah, loyalty and love is different <br>
        Loyalty is some shit, like, you gotta see <br>
        Love, people throw that shit around a lot <br>
        People throw that shit around <br>
        I don't think nobody even knows what that shit means no more <br>
        Hmm, look</p>
    <p>I liked it better when we was lowkey <br>
        Now you're tellin' all your friends that I'm different, ain't the old me <br>
        Takin' these drugs, I'm 'bout to O-D <br>
        Can't tell me that you're loyal or you love, gotta show me <br>
        Locked up in pain and you my Co-D <br>
        For all the times that we waste, we gon' need some matchin' rollies <br>
        Girl, would you ride if it's a stoley? <br>
        Girl, would you ride if it's a-, look</p>
    <p>Girl, I got some bad luck with love, so don't judge <br>
        You say you the one, so that makes two of us <br>
        You know I got some problems, I don't really trust <br>
        Took a lil' minute for my heart to adjust <br>
        I know you got some problems, you don't really trust <br>
        You don't wanna be the one to fall for a scrub <br>
        But it ain't what it was, it is what it is <br>
        Love it when I pull up, but you hate it when I dip <br>
        So you mad when I dip, we gon' take a trip <br>
        Vacation, thousand miles from the crib <br>
        Remember when you told me that you wish you would've quit <br>
        Said you wasn't fuckin' with me, threw a whole fit <br>
        I was runnin' to a bag, told me stay up out the mix <br>
        She know I be stressin' 'cause my brothers in the bricks <br>
        You know how I'm livin', so I gotta take risks <br>
        Think I'm with some bitch, but I'm probably makin' hits
    </p>
    <p>I liked it better when we was lowkey <br>

    <p>Every time I'm in a jam, you the one that I call <br>
        Pass my assist on the court, we gon' ball <br>
        Got a call from the gang, said they finna break the law <br>
        Know I gotta go, know I gotta get involved <br>
        Break up, make up, we done been through it all <br>
        Call before I walk, stood ten toes tall <br>
        Even if we fall apart, both left a mark <br>
        Last one I'm lovin', after that it's fuck 'em all <br>
        I'm the best in the league, Mike Jordan <br>
        She gon' make it bounce, like Spalding <br>
        I know what she need, ice water <br>
        Cool it down, she been actin' out of order <br>
        Actin' like she leavin', but she can't <br>
        Said her heart won't let her take the chance <br>
        She be actin' like she leavin', but she can't <br>
        Nuh-uh, won't let her take the chance</p>
